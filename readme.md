Performance Metrics: Comprehensive portfolio metrics, including net profit, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio (daily, annualized), Sortino ratio (daily, annualized), buy & hold return, open P&L, profit factor, total closed trades, winning/losing trades, and more.
Visualizations: Equity curve, underwater plot (drawdown), PnL per trade, trade duration distribution, MFE vs. MAE scatter, monthly returns heatmap, and rolling Sharpe ratio.
Advanced Analytics:
Anomaly detection for identifying outlier trades (e.g., lucky wins or poor exits).
Monte Carlo simulations (Student's t or historical methods).
Portfolio optimization (Sharpe-optimized and hierarchical risk parity allocations).


Exports: PDF report with metrics and AI insights; CSV export of trade data.
User Interface: Modern, responsive Streamlit dashboard with tooltips, date filters, and customizable inputs (initial equity, risk-free rate, timeframe).

Notes

Metric Methodology: Metrics like Sharpe and Sortino ratios are calculated using daily returns, which may differ from TradingViewâ€™s per-trade calculations. Daily-based metrics are standard for portfolio analysis.
Open Trades: Open trades are detected and reported separately in metrics like open P&L and total open trades.
CSS Design: Metric cards are styled for responsive display, preventing text overflow for large values.
Support: For issues or customization, contact support@ahmedscryptoholdings.com.

Troubleshooting

Excel Errors: Ensure the "List of trades" sheet exists and columns match the required format.
Display Issues: Use a compatible browser (Chrome, Firefox recommended) and check screen resolution for optimal rendering.
